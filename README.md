# mLRS Flasher Desktop App #

Link to the [mLRS project](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS).


## Installation ##

### Windows ###

mLRSFlasher is based on Python, and thus needs a full Python3 installation on your system. Not very Win-like, we know, and we appologize for this. 

- Install Python3 on your system, if you don't yet have it. Ensure that Python is in the PATH (the usual Python installation tutorials tell how to check that).
- Download the github repo and ensure you have unpacked it if you downloaded it as zip.
- Run the mLRS_Flasher.py script.
    - ***Note***: mLRS_Flasher needs the rights to write to disk and modify files on disk.
- It may happen that you get a bunch of errors and need to install additional packages. Follow the error messages. (you need "pillow", "requests", "pyserial", "customtkinter", "tk", "pymavlink")

### MacOS ###

#### Run the Flasher ####

````
./run_mLRS_Flasher_mac.sh
````

### Linux ###

## Disclaimer ##

You of course use the app fully at your own risk.
